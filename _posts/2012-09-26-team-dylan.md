Dylan is the Prettymaker in Chief at Second Bit. It is his responsibility to ensure that our user interfaces are aesthetically pleasing and that our user experiences are delightful. [On loan](/blog/prettymaker-in-chief) from [LSU](http://www.lsu.edu) for the semester, Dylan is trying to make the biggest impact he can before he goes back to academia.

## Vital Signs

Dylan is a twenty-years-young native of Louisiana, and he would appreciate it if you kept the Cajun jokes to a maximum of one per day, thank you very much. As the Prettymaker in Chief of Second Bit, he spends an astronomical amount of time obsessing over gradients and drop shadows. Some would call him compulsive, but we just lovingly call him thorough.

## After Hours

When he's not trying to convince someone that rgba is the superior method to specify colors, Dylan enjoys photography, [spoken word poetry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g5wuMkxkpXQ), and [writing novels in short spans of time](http://nanowrimo.org).
