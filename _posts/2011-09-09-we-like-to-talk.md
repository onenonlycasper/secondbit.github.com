It has taken me far too long to get this set up, but I'm actually pretty pleased with how it turned out. That's right, a full five months after our website went live, we are now gracing it with a blog.

This blog is going to largely just be about company news, ideas, lessons, and directions. We haven't needed a blog for this so far, because our only real project was [2cloud](/2cloud "2cloud"), and that [has its own blog](http://blog.2cloudproject.com "2cloud blog"). But it looks like we may start pursuing other projects in the near future, and it seems silly to have a blog for each of our projects. Maybe in the future, each project will get a blog; for now, we're going to let 2cloud be the exception, not the rule.

## The Internet Is Srs Bzns

I know it's hard to believe, but [Tino](/team/tino "Tino") and I are pretty laid-back. When we first started this company, I nervously informed Tino that professionalism wasn't something I was very interested in. He responded by reassuring me that if anyone ever called me out on being unprofessional, his response would be &quot;I'm wearing a Darth Vader t-shirt. What on earth made you think we were professional?&quot;

That being said, we're going to take a pretty candid approach to this blog. Rather than just writing the usual press release shill that you see on some company blogs, we're going to be *people*. Which, I know, is a revolutionary concept. Sometimes people might get offended by what we say. Sometimes, people may disagree. Sometimes, people may call for our blood because of what we write here. That's okay. We're still going to write it.

## Here There Be Dragons

In case our website pages didn't tip you off, Tino and I are pretty big fans of [The Social Network](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016/ "The Social Network on IMDB") and Peter Pan. In fact, our &quot;office politics&quot;, if such a thing could exist without an actual office, would be bickering over which Peter Pan movie is better (the [2003 version](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0316396/ "Peter Pan (2003) on IMDB") with Jeremy Sumpter is the One True Pan, and anyone who thinks otherwise doesn't deserve Neverland).

In short, you're going to see silly puns here and rather stretched references. Why? Because they amuse us. Because we like those movies. Because we hope they'll amuse you, too. Most importantly, though, because *we can*.
