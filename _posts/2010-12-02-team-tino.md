Tino is the CFO and Project Manager for Second Bit. His duties include handling the finances, paperwork, and making sure the programmers get our new projects out in a timely manner. He has experienced middling successes in these endeavours.

## Education

After graduating (magna cum laude) from [Canisius College](http://www.canisius.edu) with four undergraduate majors including History and International Relations, Tino found the job market of 2009-10 less than ideal and decided to make a change. That change end up being &quot;co-found a software company&quot;, and it is his proudest endeavour.

Following the founding of Second Bit, Tino returned to Canisius to receive his Master's degree in Business Administration. Which should, hopefully, help with that whole &quot;managing the programmers&quot; thing.

## Future Plans

When Tino isn't trying to convince programmers to release the damn software already, he can be found attempting to re-master the French language, writing a book about the Russian-Georgian conflict, or re-watching the movie [Hook](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0102057/). Seriously, he watches that movie at least once a week.
