Paddy is the CEO and lead developer for Second Bit. He's in charge of making all of our products and projects work. As CEO, he steers the company's general direction, and is responsible for its ties to the [hacker ethic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic).

## Day Job

Paddy's full-time employment is as a Developer Experience Engineer at [Iron.io](http://www.iron.io), a startup that builds services for developers building on the cloud. His duties there include documenting, creating tools, developer outreach, and generally insuring that developers enjoy using the services.

## Tech Specs

Paddy's language of choice is [Go](http://www.golang.org), but he's also proficient with Python, Javascript, and Java (when he can't avoid it). He has an intense dislike of Ruby, but will claim he's not serious if pressed. We don't believe him.

He believes in discrete, redundant, and specialised cloud services that can be combined to create an application, much like Lego blocks combine to make super cool spaceships.
