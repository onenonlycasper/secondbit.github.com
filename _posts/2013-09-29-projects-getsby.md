Mental illnesses in the tech community is an issue that&rsquo;s being, rightfully so, given more attention. It&rsquo;s also an issue that&rsquo;s very dear to [Paddy](/team/paddy)&rsquo;s heart&mdash;he [deals with depression](http://paddyforan.getsby.co) on a daily basis.

As our contribution to this cause, we&rsquo;re trying to help surface more information about mental illnesses, both for people who are struggling with them and for people who don&rsquo;t know what the struggle is like. Rather than retyping our mission statement, we&rsquo;ll just quote the [about page](http://getsby.co/about):

> gets by is a collection of interviews with members of the tech community, talking about their experiences with mental illness. It&rsquo;s meant to be a place for people to talk about the challenges they face and the strategies they&rsquo;ve found for coping with those challenges.

We have a few great interviews up already, and we&rsquo;ll be adding more over time. If you would like to suggest an interview, please [feel free to do so](https://github.com/secondbit/getsby/issues/new).
