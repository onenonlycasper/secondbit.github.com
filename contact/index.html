<p>For us, software is <a href=\"/about\" title=\"About Second Bit\">about the people</a>. So we try to keep a healthy line of communication between us and our customers, our peers, and the people we admire&mdash;it's hard to build for people you never talk to! We love hearing stories about how are software is used, learning what makes each of our users unique and awesome, and chatting about tech with people, so please don't hesitate to get in touch.</p>

<h2>Ghosts in the machine</h2>
<p>Technically, we have an office. Mainly because New York State requires us to have a headquarters they can serve us legal notices at. But one of the wonderful things about software is that we can build it from anywhere we are.</p>

</p>So if you were planning on dropping by our offices... Well, <a href=\"/team/tino\" title=\"Tino's profile\">Tino</a> will wonder why strangers are knocking on his apartment door. Instead, get in touch, and we'll find some place to meet up!</p>"

<h2>You don't call, you don't write...</h2>

<p>We're starting to think you don't love us.</p>

<p>In all seriousness, though, we love meeting new people. Just be cautious; if you get us talking about the things we're passionate about, we may never shut up again. If you're looking to try your luck, here's how to find us:</p>

<ul>
	<li>We're on <a href="https://www.twitter.com" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>. Send us an @-mention&mdash;we're <a href="https://www.twitter.com/secondbit" title="Second Bit on Twitter">@secondbit</a>. You can also <a href="https://www.twitter.com/secondbit/team" title="The Second Bit team on Twitter">follow the team</a>, if you think the <a href="/team" title="Second Bit Team">people behind Second Bit</a> are as cool as the company is (we are).</li>
	<li>If <a href="https://www.facebook.com" title="Facebook">Facebook</a> is more your thing, don't worry&mdash;we've <a href="https://www.facebook.com/secondbit" title="Second Bit on Facebook">got a page</a> set up over there, too, though we must confess we don't use it as much as we use Twitter. Like us! We like you.</li>
	<li>Love <a href="https://plus.google.com" title="Google+">Google+</a>? Good, so do we. We've <a href="http://via.2ndb.it/plus" title="Second Bit on Google+">got a page</a> set up over there, too, and we occasionally use it to host public Hangouts, solicit feedback, share what we're working on, or just talk with people.</li>
	<li>If you're not really into that whole &quot;social media&quot; thing or want a more private form of communication, we're kind of addicted to our email. Send an email to <a href="mailto:hello@secondbit.org" title="hello@secondbit.org">hello@secondbit.org</a> and say.. err.. hello.</li>
	<li>For our open source <a href="/projects" title="Second Bit's projects">projects</a>, we use <a href="https://www.github.com" title="Github">Github</a>. We'd be flattered if you <a href="https://www.github.com/secondbit" title="Second Bit on Github">forked us</a>.</li>
	<li>Need something a bit more instant? Everyone on <a href="/team" title="Second Bit's super-awesome team">our team</a> has a Google Talk account set up. Just use their Second Bit email address when adding a buddy, and you can chat with us.</li>
	<li>Finally, if you want to hear a human voice (sometimes it's nice!), you can always give Paddy a call. His number is +1 (716) 771-2486, and he loves talking to people, so don't hesitate to call. If he doesn't pick up, just leave a voicemail. He'll call you back. Pinky promise.</li>
</ul>
