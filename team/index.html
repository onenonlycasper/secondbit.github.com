<p>Our team is reduced at the moment, as Second Bit experiences a brief period of slumber. We're working on our products, keeping our heads down, and making things we love. We'll be back in full force soon, and hope to add to this page when we do.</p>

<h2>Never forget</h2>
<p>Just because somebody moved on from Second Bit doesn't mean we love them any less. You can still find the <a href=\"/alums\" title=\"Second Bit Alumni\">profiles of our alums</a>, the people that helped shape Second Bit.</p>"
