<p>We like the term &quot;team&quot; over, say, &quot;staff&quot;, because it's a little more intimate, a little more expressive of the bond we share as we work with software. We like to think Second Bit is as much about the people as it is about the software, and we work hard to stay close and have fun as a team.</p>
<p>It's hard to do great work when you're around people you whose company you don't genuinely enjoy, so we've made it a priority to work with only the most awesome people we can find.</p>"
