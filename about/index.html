title: About Us
sidebar: "<h2>Like what you hear?</h2>

<p>Would you like to work for us? We're, unfortunately, not hiring at this point, but we like to keep tabs on people we'd <em>like</em> to work with. If nothing else, we love meeting people who share our hopes, dreams, and ideas. If you have a moment, we'd love to chat.</p>

<p>We like to hear ideas, too. Have an app idea you think can change the world? Have something that drives you nuts, that should be simpler, but you just can't seem to make it less tedious? We'd love to <a href=\"/contact\" title=\"Contact Us\">hear from you</a>.</p>

<h2>"The entire point of the thing is to work with people I like, doing things I love"</h2>

<p>Second Bit, LLC is not <i>just</i> a software company. It's a software <i>team</i>. We're not all that interested in selling software&mdash;our passion is for writing it.</p>

<p>At Second Bit, we believe in the same set of principles that drove the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tech_Model_Railroad_Club" title="MIT Tech Model Railroad Club on Wikipedia">TMRC</a> hackers at MIT. We think the best way to improve the world we live in is to give everyone the best tools we can, and to give them all the help we can. That's what drives our <a href="/services/opensource" title="Open Source projects on Second Bit">interest in Open Source</a>.</p>

<h2>We want to Do The Right Thing</h2>

<p>In the beginning of its life, the hacker movement in MIT's AI labs had a concept of "right" that we like. It's the idea that some things are <i>just right</i>. A hack was "right" when it couldn't be any more succinct, couldn't be any more elegant. It was perfect.</p>

<p>At Second Bit, we like to take this idea of "right" and apply it to everything we do. Our applications are "right" when they're decentralised and elegantly structured. Our monetisation strategy (we <i>are</i> a company, we <i>do</i> need to make money to keep the lights on) is "right" when it's an enhancement, not something we ask users to swallow. Everything, from software to blog posts to the company itself, is subjected to this standard of "right".</p>

<h2>Untapped potential</h2>

<p>We're not perfect. Nobody is. We try to keep our imperfection at the forefront of our mindsâ€”in fact, we've enshrined it as a company tagline. We have wonderful potential, but it is (and always will be) untapped. We're going to get as close as we can to fulfilling it, but our potential is just too great.</p>

<p>We need you. We need everyone. Our projects and products, unless there's a legal reason preventing it, tend to be Open Source. We accept contributions, whether it's an email or pull request. We know the only way we're ever going to do anything worthwhile is if we stand on the shoulders of giants, and we're flattered if giants decide to stand on our shoulders.</p>
